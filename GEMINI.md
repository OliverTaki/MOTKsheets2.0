# Gemini CLI Session Notes

**Project:** `motksheets2-frontend`

**Last Session Date:** 2025-07-03

## Summary of Progress

We successfully implemented and debugged two major features:
1.  **In-place Cell Editing:** Users can now click on a cell in the `ShotTable` to edit its value. The changes are saved to the Google Sheet.
2.  **Field Creation:** A `FieldManager` component was added, allowing users to define and append new fields (columns) to the sheet.

The latest change also ensures that when a new field is added, its human-readable name is populated in the second row of the "Shots" sheet for clarity.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a component-based architecture using React. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their roles:

*   **`AppContainer.jsx`**: The main container for the application. It manages the overall state, including the data from Google Sheets, and passes it down to the other components.
*   **`ShotTable.jsx`**: Displays the data from the "Shots" sheet in a table. It handles user interactions like cell editing and column resizing.
*   **`Toolbar.jsx`**: Provides filtering, sorting, and other controls for the `ShotTable`.
*   **`FieldManager.jsx`**: A form for adding new fields to the sheet.
*   **`useSheetsData.js`**: A custom hook that fetches and parses data from the Google Sheet. It also provides functions for updating the sheet.
*   **`appendField.js`**: An API function that adds a new field to the "FIELDS" sheet and a new column to the "Shots" sheet.
*   **`updateCell.js`**: An API function that updates a single cell in the Google Sheet.
*   **`parse.js`**: Contains functions for parsing the raw data from the Google Sheet into a more usable format.

## Last Action

The changes were committed and pushed to the `feature/mui-dropdowns` branch on GitHub.

- **Commit Message:** "feat: Implement cell editing and field adding"
- **Next Step:** A pull request can be created from this branch to merge the features into `main`.

## Future Plans (Next Session)

The next major feature is to allow users to save their view configurations as named "Pages." This will involve the following:

### 1. View Configuration Persistence:
- **Column Widths**: The current width of each column in the `ShotTable` should be saved.
- **Column Order**: The user should be able to reorder columns, and this order should be saved.
- **Filter Settings**: The active filters applied to the table need to be persisted.
- **Field Visibility**: The set of currently visible columns should be saved.
- **Sort Order**: The current sort key and direction (ascending/descending) should be saved.

### 2. Page Management in Google Sheets:
- A new sheet named "PAGES" will be used to store these view configurations.
- Each row in the "PAGES" sheet will represent a saved page.
- When a user saves a view, a new row will be added to the "PAGES" sheet.
- **Page ID**: A unique UUID will be generated for each new page at the time of creation.
- The page will store all the view configuration settings listed above.

### 3. UI/UX:
- A mechanism will be needed to load, save, and manage these saved pages (e.g., a dropdown menu in the toolbar).

## To Continue
