# Gemini CLI Session Notes

**Project:** `motksheets2-frontend`

**Last Session Date:** 2025-07-06

## Summary of Progress

We have been working on implementing a "Pages" feature that allows users to save and load different view configurations for the main shot table. We have also been addressing several layout and functionality issues.

### Key Features and Bug Fixes:

*   **View Management:**
    *   A dropdown menu in the `Toolbar` allows users to load saved pages.
    *   A "Manage Views" dialog provides functionality for saving, renaming, and deleting views.
    *   The application uses the browser's `localStorage` to remember and automatically reload the last used view.
*   **Column Customization:**
    *   Users can reorder columns by dragging and dropping the column headers.
    *   Users can resize columns by dragging the edge of the column header.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Addressed a critical issue where the application would crash if the "PAGES" sheet contained corrupted data. The application now safely handles these errors and loads with the valid pages.
    *   Fixed a conflict between column resizing and reordering, where both actions would happen at the same time.
    *   Corrected the table height so that it is determined by its content, not the window size.
    *   Fixed a bug where newly added fields were not appearing in the "Manage Fields" menu when an old view was loaded.
    *   Fixed a bug where adding a new field would reset the current view.
    *   Fixed a bug where the application would not load the saved view on reload.
    *   Fixed a bug where the `FIELDS` sheet was not being parsed correctly, causing new fields to be ignored.
    *   Implemented advanced filtering with type-specific operators and inputs (checkbox lists for select fields, text input for image fields).
*   **Fixed Date Editing:** Resolved issues with date input fields, allowing users to type dates in MM/DD/YYYY format with automatic slash insertion, and ensuring correct saving to Google Sheets in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Current Status and Known Issues

The application is in a partially stable state. While the core functionality of the "Pages" feature is in place, there are still some critical issues that need to be addressed:

*   **Page Deletion:** The page deletion functionality has been improved by trimming whitespace from `pageId`s during comparison in `deletePage.js`. However, the "PAGES sheet not found" error might still persist if the sheet itself is missing or due to other data corruption.
*   **Data Corruption:** The root cause of the page deletion issue is often corrupted data in the "PAGES" sheet. This data needs to be manually removed from the Google Sheet to fully resolve the issue.
*   **Toolbar.jsx Syntax Error:** Resolved by removing a redundant fragment.
*   **Toolbar Freezing:** Addressed by memoizing `fields` and `pages` in `AppContainer.jsx` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Table Scrollbar:** Implemented a dedicated scrollable container for the `ShotTable` in `AppContainer.jsx` to ensure the scrollbar applies only to the table content, not the toolbar or other fixed elements.
*   **Fixed Headers & Backgrounds:** Refactored `ShotTable.jsx` to ensure the table header (field row) and filter row remain fixed while the table body scrolls, and explicitly set backgrounds for fixed elements in `AppContainer.jsx` and `ShotTable.jsx`. Restored `overflow-auto` to the `ShotTable` container in `AppContainer.jsx`. Simplified `Toolbar` sticky positioning in `AppContainer.jsx`. Removed manual `position: sticky` from `TableRow` elements in `ShotTable.jsx` and relied on `stickyHeader` prop of `Table`. Fixed `AppContainer.jsx` syntax error by removing extra `>`.

## Next Steps

Our immediate priority is to ensure the "Pages" feature is fully stable. After that, we will move on to implementing the "Add Shot" and "Shot Detail" pages.

### 1. Finalize the "Pages" Feature

*   **Verify Page Deletion:** Confirm that the `deletePage.js` fix (whitespace trimming) has resolved all page deletion issues. If not, further investigation into data consistency or API interactions will be required.
*   **Manual Data Cleanup:** The corrupted data in the "PAGES" sheet needs to be manually removed from the Google Sheet. This is a one-time action that will unblock the development process.

### 2. Implement the "Add Shot" Page

*   **Create a New Component:** We will create a new component called `AddShotPage.jsx` that will contain a form for adding a new shot.
*   **Form Fields:** The form will have fields for all the editable columns in the "Shots" sheet.
*   **API Integration:** The form will use the `appendRow.js` API function to add a new row to the "Shots" sheet.
*   **State Management:** The application's state will be updated to reflect the new shot, and the user will be redirected to the main shot table after the new shot is added.
*   **Fixes Implemented:**
    *   Corrected `appendRow` arguments in `AddShotPage.jsx`.
    *   Hid the auto-generated "Shot ID" field from the form.
    *   Ensured correct placement of `shot_id` in the sheet.
    *   Resolved application freezing issue when adding shots.

### 3. Implement the "Shot Detail" Page

*   **Enhance the Existing Component:** We will enhance the existing `ShotDetailPage.jsx` component to provide a more detailed view of a single shot.
*   **Editable Fields:** All the editable fields for the shot will be displayed in a user-friendly layout.
*   **API Integration:** The component will use the `updateCell.js` API function to update the shot's data in the "Shots" sheet.
*   **State Management:** The application's state will be updated to reflect any changes made to the shot.

By following this plan, we will be able to complete the "Pages" feature and then move on to implementing the core functionality of the application.

### 4. Non-UUID ID Update Refactoring

*   **Button Visible for Testing:** The "Update Non-UUID IDs" button is now visible in the UI for testing purposes.
*   **Debugging Field Parsing:** Added `console.log` statements to `src/hooks/useSheetsData.js` to inspect `parsedFields` and `finalFields` arrays during data fetching.
