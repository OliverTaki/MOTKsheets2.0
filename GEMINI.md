# Gemini CLI Session Notes

**Project:** `motksheets2-frontend`

**Last Session Date:** 2025-07-04

## Summary of Progress

We have been working on implementing a "Pages" feature that allows users to save and load different view configurations for the main shot table. We have also been addressing several layout and functionality issues.

### Key Features and Bug Fixes:

*   **View Management:**
    *   A dropdown menu in the `Toolbar` allows users to load saved pages.
    *   A "Manage Views" dialog provides functionality for saving, renaming, and deleting views.
    *   The application uses the browser's `localStorage` to remember and automatically reload the last used view.
*   **Column Customization:**
    *   Users can reorder columns by dragging and dropping the column headers.
    *   Users can resize columns by dragging the edge of the column header.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Addressed a critical issue where the application would crash if the "PAGES" sheet contained corrupted data. The application now safely handles these errors and loads with the valid pages.
    *   Fixed a conflict between column resizing and reordering, where both actions would happen at the same time.
    *   Corrected the table height so that it is determined by its content, not the window size.

## Current Status and Known Issues

The application is in a partially stable state. While the core functionality of the "Pages" feature is in place, there are still some critical issues that need to be addressed:

*   **Page Deletion:** The page deletion functionality is still not working correctly. The application fails to delete pages, and the "PAGES sheet not found" error persists.
*   **Data Corruption:** The root cause of the page deletion issue is corrupted data in the "PAGES" sheet. This data needs to be manually removed from the Google Sheet to fully resolve the issue.

## Next Steps

Our immediate priority is to resolve the outstanding issues with the "Pages" feature. After that, we will move on to implementing the "Add Shot" and "Shot Detail" pages.

### 1. Finalize the "Pages" Feature

*   **Fix Page Deletion:** The `deletePage.js` file needs to be corrected to ensure that it can reliably delete pages from the "PAGES" sheet. This will likely involve a more robust implementation of the `ensureSheetExists` function and a more careful handling of the Google Sheets API.
*   **Manual Data Cleanup:** The corrupted data in the "PAGES" sheet needs to be manually removed from the Google Sheet. This is a one-time action that will unblock the development process.

### 2. Implement the "Add Shot" Page

*   **Create a New Component:** We will create a new component called `AddShotPage.jsx` that will contain a form for adding a new shot.
*   **Form Fields:** The form will have fields for all the editable columns in the "Shots" sheet.
*   **API Integration:** The form will use the `appendRow.js` API function to add a new row to the "Shots" sheet.
*   **State Management:** The application's state will be updated to reflect the new shot, and the user will be redirected to the main shot table after the new shot is added.

### 3. Implement the "Shot Detail" Page

*   **Enhance the Existing Component:** We will enhance the existing `ShotDetailPage.jsx` component to provide a more detailed view of a single shot.
*   **Editable Fields:** All the editable fields for the shot will be displayed in a user-friendly layout.
*   **API Integration:** The component will use the `updateCell.js` API function to update the shot's data in the "Shots" sheet.
*   **State Management:** The application's state will be updated to reflect any changes made to the shot.

By following this plan, we will be able to complete the "Pages" feature and then move on to implementing the core functionality of the application.
